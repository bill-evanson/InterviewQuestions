Interview Questions
==================


Thank you for interviewing with us.

Seeing how you code and problem solve is an important part of our interview process.  We think that giving you an assignment ahead of time, rather than asking you to write code during the interview is a better gauge of your skills, and more like how most developers work.

Please select one of the included excersises and solve the problem using Java.  You are welcome to use any libraries that you'd like but make sure your solution includes any jars needed to allow us to compile and run your answer. Clone down this code to your local machine and complete the exercises, then zip up your solution and send it to me at bill-evanson@uiowa.edu at least a day ahead of your actual interview.  Be aware that if you choose to fork the repository, anyone could see that you did so(if that is a concern to you).

As part of your interview day with us, we'll ask you to review your solution with a small group of other developers on our team.

We look forward to meeting you soon.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill Evanson
