Problem Statement
=================

Using the [github api](http://developer.github.com/v3/) create a web app that lists commit history for a specific repository (e.g. [twbs/bootstrap](http://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)). It should display the following commit information for each commit

* commit author information
  * name
  * email
  * github login if applicable
* commit date
* commit message
* link to the github commit page

There should be pagination links for navigating around the commits. _hint: [#pagination](http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination)_

Please use primarily Java server side technologies to solve this problem.  You may use a web application framework if you choose to although simple servelet and jsp (and web.xml) is fine.
